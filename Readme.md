# Project Name: Peddy - Pet Adoption Platform

## Project Description
**Welcome to Peddy - Pet Adoption Platform !!!** Peddy is an intuitive and visually appealing pet adoption platform that aims to streamline the process of finding and adopting pets. Users can browse through a wide variety of pets, access detailed information and apply for adoption. Peddy focuses on providing a seamless experience and making it more easier for users to find their perfect pet. Additionally, the website provides detailed information about each pet, ensuring adopters are fully informed before making their decision.

## Key Features
1. **Pet Listings by Pet Category**:
   - A dynamic list of pets available for adoption with detailed profiles including photos, name, breed, age, date of birth, gender, price and adoption status.
   - Users can quickly find specific types of pets by pet category (cat, dog, rabbit, bird) and other criteria like special needs or adoptable status.

2. **Dynamic Sorting Functionality of Pets**:
   - Real-time sorting functionality that dynamically updates pet listings according to price when the "Sort by Price" button is clicked.
   - When users click on the "Sort by Price" button, the pet listings update in descending order based on pet's price so that users can quickly find specific breeds or types of pets.

3. **Pet Detail Modal**:
   - When users click on details button of a pet card, a modal window appears, providing detailed information about the pet, including personality traits, medical history and care requirements.
   - This feature improves the user experience by keeping the main page clean while offering rich details on-demand.

4. **Interactive Adoption and Adoption Event Countdown**:
   - Implement an interactive adoption process. When the "Adopt" button is clicked, it will show a countdown (3, 2, 1) and then change the button text to "Adopted."
   - The countdown timer also auto-closes event modal after a set duration (3 seconds).

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - The entire site is responsive, ensuring that users can browse and apply for adoption on any device, including mobile phones and tablets.
   - The layout dynamically adjusts to different screen sizes, making it easy to navigate across devices.

## ES6 Features
The project utilizes modern JavaScript ES6 features, including:
- **Arrow Functions**: Used for handling events and callbacks more succinctly. They make code more readable.
- **Template Literals**: For embedding dynamic HTML and content in templates.
- **Destructuring**: For extracting properties from objects such as pet details from the API.
- **Modules**: The code is modularized into different files for better organization and maintainability.
- **Promises & Async-Await**: Used to handle API requests to fetch pet data asynchronously.
